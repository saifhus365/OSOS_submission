Conventional treatment approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have been in use, while \\nsignificant advances are being made in recent times, including stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, ablation therapy, \\nnanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis-based therapy. \\nCurrent methods in oncology focus on the development of safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Stem cell therapy has \\nbrought promising efficacy in regenerating and repairing diseased or damaged tissues by targeting both primary and metastatic \\ncancer foci, and nanoparticles brought new diagnostic and therapeutic options. Targeted therapy possessed breakthrough \\npotential inhibiting the growth and spread of specific cancer cells, causing less damage to healthy cells.

In this era worldwide, over half of all ongoing \\nmedical treatment trials are focusing on cancer treatments.7 \\nEntities, such as the type of cancer, its site, and severity, guide \\nto select treatment options and its progress. The most widely \\nused traditional treatment methods are surgery, chemotherapy, \\nand radiotherapy, while modern modalities include hormone \\ntherapy, anti-angiogenic, stem cell therapies, immunotherapy, \\nand dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.10\\nConventional cancer therapies\\nThe most recommended conventional cancer treatment strat-\\negies include surgical resection of the tumors followed by \\nradiotherapy with x-rays and/or chemotherapy.11 Of these \\nmodalities, surgery is most effective at an early stage of dis-\\nease progression. Radiation therapy can damage healthy \\ncells, organs, and tissues. Although chemotherapy has \\nreduced morbidity and mortality, virtually all chemothera-\\npeutic agents damage healthy cells, especially rapidly divid-\\ning and growing cells.12 Drug resistance, a major problem \\nwith chemotherapy, is a phenomenon wherein cancer cells \\nthat initially were suppressed by an anti-cancer drug develop', ' chemothera-\\npeutic agents damage healthy cells, especially rapidly divid-\\ning and growing cells.12 Drug resistance, a major problem \\nwith chemotherapy, is a phenomenon wherein cancer cells \\nthat initially were suppressed by an anti-cancer drug develop \\nresistance to the drug. This is caused primarily by reduced \\ndrug uptake and increased drug efflux.13 Limitations of con-\\nventional chemotherapeutic modality, such as dosage selec-\\ntion difficulty, lack of specificity, rapid drug metabolism, \\nand mainly harmful side effects.14\\nAdvanced and innovative cancer \\ntherapies\\nAmong the obstacles of cancer, drug resistance and its deliv-\\nery systems are the most problem in cancer cure and decreas-\\ning signs and symptoms; but currently, there are many \\napproved treatment approaches and drugs. The efficiency of \\nconventional cancer is reduced due to tumor pathology and \\narchitectural abnormality of tumor tissue blood vessels.15 \\nThe following are the advanced and innovative cancer ther-\\napy types with their benefits and challenges.\\nStem cells therapy\\nStem cells are undifferentiated cells present in the bone mar-\\nrow (BM) with an ability to differentiate into any type of \\nbody cell.

Application of stem cell is yet in the experi-\\nmental clinical trial; for example, their use in the regenera-\\ntion of other damaged tissue is being explored. Mesenchymal \\nstem cells (MSCs) are currently being used in trials that are \\ndelivered from the BM, fat tissues, and connective tissues.16\\nPluripotent stem cells\\nEmbryonic stem cells (ESCs) isolated from the uniform \\ninner mass cells of the embryo possess the flexibility to \\nadminister rise to any or all kinds of cells except those within \\nthe placenta. In 2006, the invention of Yamanaka factors to \\ninduce pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from physical cells in \\na culture marked a breakthrough in cell biology.17 Avoiding \\nethical issues from embryo destruction, iPSCs and ESCs \\nhave the same characteristics. Hematopoietic embryonic \\nstem cells (hESCs) and iPSCs are currently used for the \\ninduction of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells,18 \\nand anti-tumor vaccine preparation.19\\nAdult stem cells\\nAdult stem cells (ASCs) groups often used in tumor therapy \\ninclude hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), MSCs, and neural \\nstem cells (NSCs). HSCs', ' vaccine preparation.19\\nAdult stem cells\\nAdult stem cells (ASCs) groups often used in tumor therapy \\ninclude hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), MSCs, and neural \\nstem cells (NSCs). HSCs, located in BM, can form all mature \\nblood cells in the body. Currently, only approved by the Food \\nand Drug Administration (FDA) is the infusion of HSCs \\nderived from cord blood to treat multiple myeloma and leu-\\nkemia.20 MSCs are found in many tissues and organs, play-\\ning important roles in tissue repair and regeneration into \\ncells, such as osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. \\nMSCs have special biological characteristics and are used as \\ncomplimentary with other approaches in treating tumors.21 \\nNSCs can self-renew and generate new neurons and glial \\ncells and are used for treating both primary and metastatic \\nbreast and other tumors.22\\nCancer stem cells\\nCancer stem cells (CSCs) are generated in normal stem cells \\nor precursor/progenitor cells by the epigenetic mutations \\nprocess. Their role in tumor treatment includes cancer \\ngrowth, metastasis, and recurrence, so that it could give \\npromise in the treatment of solid tumors.23 Stem cells have \\nseveral action mechanisms in treating the tumor. The homing \\n\\nDebela et al.\\t\\n3\\nprocess is one mechanism', 'asis, and recurrence, so that it could give \\npromise in the treatment of solid tumors.23 Stem cells have \\nseveral action mechanisms in treating the tumor. The homing \\n\\nDebela et al.\\t\\n3\\nprocess is one mechanism which is a rapid migration of \\nHSCs into defined stem cell niches in BM after that the \\ntransplants undergo the engraftment process before giving \\nrise to specialized blood cells. This mechanism is dependent \\non the active interaction between stem cell CXCR4 receptors \\nand requires their interaction with endothelial cells through \\nLFA-1, VLA-4/5, CD44, and the secretion of matrix degra-\\ndable enzyme MMP-2/9.22 The second mechanism is the \\ntumor-tropic effect in which the migration of MSCs toward \\ntumor microenvironment (TM) after attraction by CXCL16, \\nSDF-1, CCL-25, and IL-6 secreted by tumor cells and dif-\\nferentiation of MSCs within the tumor cells which contrib-\\nutes to tumor stromal development.24 Stem cells also act by \\nparacrine factor secretion, including extracellular vesicles \\n(EVs) and soluble materials,25 and their differentiation \\ncapacity, such as transplanted HSCs, can give rise to all \\nblood cell types.26\\nGenerally, cancer treatment using stem cell therapy by \\nvarious strategies, including transplantation of H', ' and soluble materials,25 and their differentiation \\ncapacity, such as transplanted HSCs, can give rise to all \\nblood cell types.26\\nGenerally, cancer treatment using stem cell therapy by \\nvarious strategies, including transplantation of HSC,27 MSC \\ninfusion,28 therapeutic carriers,29 generation of immune \\neffector cells,30 and vaccine production.31 The stem cell can-\\ncer therapy approach confronted the following side effects: \\n(1) tumorigenesis, (2) adverse events in allogeneic HSC \\ntransplantation, (3) drug toxicity and drug resistance, (4) \\nincreased immune responses and autoimmunity, and (5) viral \\ninfection.22 Despite several successes, there are challenges, \\nsuch as therapeutic dose control, low cell targeting, and \\nretention in tumor sites, that should be investigated and over-\\ncome in the future. In addition, existing results from stem \\ncell technologies are highly encouraging for tumor treatment \\nbut it still needs further efforts to improve the safety and effi-\\ncacy before they could enter clinical trials. Table 1 summa-\\nrized the licensed list of stem cell therapies.\\nTargeted drug therapy\\nTargeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances \\nwhich are sometimes interchangeably used as “molecularly \\ntargeted drugs,” “molecularly targeted therapies,” and “pre-\\ncision medicines.” Those drugs’ mechanism of action is by \\ninterfer', 'ed cancer therapies are drugs or other substances \\nwhich are sometimes interchangeably used as “molecularly \\ntargeted drugs,” “molecularly targeted therapies,” and “pre-\\ncision medicines.” Those drugs’ mechanism of action is by \\ninterfering with growth molecules which leads to blocking \\nthe growth and spreading of cancer.34 Tumor initiation and \\nprogression are determined by the TM of an atypical tumor \\nwhich comprises endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle \\ncells, fibroblasts, various inflammatory cells, dendritic cells, \\nand CSCs. There are various signaling mechanisms and \\npathways that TM-forming cells dynamically interact with \\nthe cancerous cells which are suitable for sustaining a rea-\\nsonably high cellular proliferation. So, it is the area of \\nresearch interest using TM conditions to mediate effective \\ntargeting measures for cancer therapy.35\\nSelectively treating cancer cells with conventional chem-\\notherapy is difficult since it is similar to normal cells. So \\nthose problems are intervened by cellular mechanisms, such \\nas cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, proliferation pre-\\nvention, and interfering with metabolic reprogramming by \\ntargeted drug therapy agents.36 Modifying TM and targeting \\nTM for drug delivery for effective treatment are two strate-\\ngies that can be used for the treatment of cancer.37 Targeted \\ntherapy drugs do work in different ways from standard \\nchemotherapy drugs treatment like attacking cancer cells \\nwhile doing less damage to normal', ' drug delivery for effective treatment are two strate-\\ngies that can be used for the treatment of cancer.37 Targeted \\ntherapy drugs do work in different ways from standard \\nchemotherapy drugs treatment like attacking cancer cells \\nwhile doing less damage to normal cells which is a program-\\nming that sets them apart from normal, healthy cells.38\\nUsing targeted therapy markedly increased the survival \\nrate for some diseases, for example, from 17% to 24% in \\npatients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the addition of \\nerlotinib to standard chemotherapy. Imatinib has had a dra-\\nmatic effect on chronic myeloid leukemia, and rituximab, \\nsunitinib, and trastuzumab have revolutionized the treatment \\nof renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer, respectively.39\\nWe can classify the targeted cell agents based on the \\nmechanism of their work or their target site. Some enzymes \\nserve as signals for cancer cells to grow. Some targeted ther-\\napies inhibit enzymes that are signals for cancer cells to \\ngrow. These drugs are called enzyme inhibitors. Blocking \\nthese cell signals can inhibit cancer from getting bigger and \\nspreading.40\\nSome targeted therapies are called apoptosis-inducing \\ndrugs because they are aimed right at the parts of the cell that \\ncontrol whether cells live or die.

In addition, they arrest tumor growth \\nthat involves by curtailing blood supply to the tumor by \\ninhibiting angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial \\ngrowth factor (VEGF) or its receptors.

Their main func-\\ntion is interrupting cellular processes by interfering with the \\nintracellular signaling of tyrosine kinases which leads to the \\ninhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling and initiates a molecu-\\nlar cascade that can lead to the inhibition of cell growth, pro-\\nliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in malignant tissues.48 \\nExamples of small molecule inhibitors are gefitinib and erlo-\\ntinib which inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \\nkinase and EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \\npatients, respectively. There are also lapatinib and sorafenib \\nwhich act on the inhibition of EGFR/Erb-B2 Receptor \\nTyrosine Kinase 2 (ERBB2) for ERBB2-positive breast can-\\ncer and VEGFR kinase, in renal cancer.49\\nAblation cancer therapy\\nAblation is a treatment technique that destroys tumors with-\\nout removing them mostly', ' 2 (ERBB2) for ERBB2-positive breast can-\\ncer and VEGFR kinase, in renal cancer.49\\nAblation cancer therapy\\nAblation is a treatment technique that destroys tumors with-\\nout removing them mostly indicated for small-size tumors of \\nless than 3\\u2009cm and the surgical option is contraindicated. \\nAblation is also used with embolization for larger tumors. \\nHowever, this technique might not be indicated for treating \\ntumors near major blood vessels, the diaphragm, or major \\nbile ducts due to destroying some of the normal tissue around \\nthe tumor.50\\nThermal ablation\\nThis technique uses extreme hyperthermia or hypothermia to \\ndestruct tumor tissue concentrating on a focal zone in and \\naround the tumor. Similar to surgery, thermal ablation \\nremoves the tumor and a 5–10\\u2009mm thick margin of seem-\\ningly normal tissue but the tissue is killed in situ and then \\nabsorbed by the body later. The procedure is similar to sur-\\ngery using an open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic approach \\nbut is commonly applied using a percutaneous or non-inva-\\nsive approach. The type of tumor, site, physician’s choice, \\nand health status determine the approach.51\\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, \\nhigh-intensity focused ultrasound, and cryoab', 'va-\\nsive approach. The type of tumor, site, physician’s choice, \\nand health status determine the approach.51\\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, \\nhigh-intensity focused ultrasound, and cryoablation are cur-\\nrently being used in the clinical setting. Cryoablation uses a \\nhypothermic modality to induce tissue damage by a freeze-\\nthaw process against others. All these treatments operate on \\nthe principle of hyperthermia except cryoablation. Of all the \\nablation techniques, cryoablation demonstrated the highest \\npotential to elicit a post-ablative immunogenic response.52\\nRecent studies showed additional to tissue disruption \\nRFA and cryoablation can modulate the immune system that \\nthey were applied as therapy on TM and in the systematic \\ncirculation. Evidence has shown that ablation procedures \\naffect carcinogenesis due to its local inflammatory response \\nleading to an immunogenic gene signature.53\\nThe advantage of this procedure over surgery is that it \\nprovides a minimal (e.g. percutaneously or laparoscopically) \\nor non-invasive approach to cancer therapy and gets atten-\\ntion as an alternative to standard surgical therapies.54\\nCryoablation\\nCryoablation is one of the ablation techniques which ablates \\nthe extensive tissue by freezing to lethal temperatures fol-\\nlowed by liquid formation, causing extensive tissue.

Benign \\nand malignant primary tumors are mostly treated by this \\ntherapy.55 James Arnott reported that the freezing tempera-\\ntures can impair cancer cell viability after he attempted the \\nusage of cold temperatures by salt and ice solutions for the \\ngeneration of local numbness before surgical operations in \\nthe nineteenth century. He suggested cryoablation as an \\nattractive therapeutic option and increased a patient’s \\nsurvival.56\\nCryoablation techniques are based on the principle of the \\nJoule–Thomson effect which was studied in the 1930s by \\nmany researchers and concluded using liquid CO2 under \\nhigh pressure, liquid air, and liquid oxygen to achieve the \\ncooling effect and the subsequent formation of ice crystals so \\nemployed to treat lesions, warts, and keratosis. However, \\nafter 1950, Allington replaced liquid N2 for the treatment of \\nvarious skin lesion disorders.47\\nRFA therapy\\nRFA is a minimally invasive procedure and an image-guided \\ntechnique using hyperthermic (high-frequency electrical \\ncurrents) conditions to destroy cancer cells.

Generally, RFA is the most effective \\napproach for treating small-size tumors of less than 3\\u2009cm in \\ndiameter. RFA can be used in combination with other con-\\nventional cancer treatment options.57 After starting the use of \\ndeployable devices or multiple-electrode systems, RFA can \\ntreat medium tumors (up to 5\\u2009cm diameter).58\\nGene therapy\\nGene therapy is the insertion of a normal copy of a defective \\ngene in the genome to cure a specific disorder. The first \\napplication dates back to 1990 when a retroviral vector was \\nexploited to deliver the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene to \\nT cells in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency \\n(SCID). Approximately, about 2900 gene therapy clinical tri-\\nals are currently ongoing, two-third of which are related to \\ncancer.

Strategies, such as expression of proapoptotic and \\nchemosensitizing genes, expression of wild-type tumor sup-\\npressor genes, expression of genes able to solicit specific \\nanti-tumor immune responses, and targeted silencing of \\noncogenes, are under evaluation for cancer gene therapy.47\\nThymidine kinase (TK) gene delivery is effective for the \\nadministration of prodrug ganciclovir to activate its expres-\\nsion and induce specific cytotoxicity.59 The p53 tumor sup-\\npressor gene which is vectors carrying has been assessed for \\nthe clinical purpose very recently. ONYX-015 has been \\ntested in NSCLC patients and gave a high response rate \\nwhen given alone or combined with chemotherapy.60 \\nGendicine, a recombinant adenovirus carrying wild-type \\np53-induced complete disease regression in head and neck \\nsquamous cell cancer had similar success when combined \\nwith radiotherapy.61\\nSome challenges that have been faced with gene therapy \\nare the selection of the right conditions and the choice of the \\nbest delivery mechanism. Identified drawbacks of this ther-\\napy are genome integration, limited efficacy in specific sub-\\nsets of patients, and high chances of being neutralized by the \\nimmune system.

This \\nmethod relies on siRNA-mediated gene silencing of anti-\\napoptotic proteins, transcription factors (i.e. c-myc gene),64,65 \\nor cancer mutated genes (i.e. K-RAS).66\\nAdvantages of siRNA-based drugs are safety, high effi-\\ncacy, specificity, few side effects, and low costs of produc-\\ntion.67 However, occasionally, they can induce off-target \\neffects or elicit innate immune responses, followed by spe-\\ncific inflammation.68 Delivery methods currently under study \\nare chemical modification (insertion of a phosphorothioate at \\n3’ end, introduction of a 2’ O-methyl group, and modification \\nby 2,4-dinitrophenol) and lipid encapsulation, or conjugation \\nwith organic molecules (polymers,', 'ioate at \\n3’ end, introduction of a 2’ O-methyl group, and modification \\nby 2,4-dinitrophenol) and lipid encapsulation, or conjugation \\nwith organic molecules (polymers, peptides, lipids, antibod-\\nies, small molecules) efficiently target to spontaneously cross \\ncell membranes of naked siRNAs.69 Interaction of cationic \\nliposomes with negatively charged nucleic acids facilitates \\neasy transfection by simple electrostatic interactions.70 They \\ncan be constituted by 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium \\npropane (DOTAP) and N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N, \\nNtrimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTMA).71 Currently, \\na Phase I clinical trial is recruiting patients for evaluating the \\nsafety of Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) targeting 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-\\nglycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) encapsulated siRNA \\n(siRNA-EphA2- DOPC) in patients with advanced and recur-\\nrent cancer.72 siRNAs can be concentrated in cationic poly-\\nmers, such as chitosan, cyclodextrin, and polyethyleneimine \\n(PEI).73 CALAA-01 is one of the cyclodextrin polymers con', 'RNAs can be concentrated in cationic poly-\\nmers, such as chitosan, cyclodextrin, and polyethyleneimine \\n(PEI).73 CALAA-01 is one of the cyclodextrin polymers con-\\njugated with human transferrin is being entered a Phase I \\nclinical trial.

Conjugating to peptides, anti-\\nbodies, and aptamers improves stability during circulation \\nand enhances cellular uptake of siRNAs.75 The introduction \\nof nanocarriers has largely improved siRNAs stability, phar-\\nmacokinetics and biodistribution properties, and targeting \\nspecificity.
